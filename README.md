# Hyper Oculus

## Overview
Hyper-Oculus is an open source project that aims to visualize the 4D space using computer graphics techniques. The project itself is like an hyper external organ in four-dimensional space, hence the name "Hyper-Oculus". The goal of this project is to provide an intuitive way for people to understand and explore the 4D space, ultimately leading to the creation of a four-dimensional meta world.

## Vision for a Four-Dimensional Meta World
The goal of the "Hyper-Oculus" project is to create a platform for visualizing the fourth dimension, with the ultimate aim of building a four-dimensional meta world that can be inhabited by users. This meta world would allow people to experience and explore four-dimensional space in a way that is not currently possible in our three-dimensional world.

Imagine being able to manipulate and observe objects in four dimensions, to walk through four-dimensional structures, and to interact with other users in a fully immersive four-dimensional environment. This level of understanding of four-dimensional space could open up new opportunities in fields such as mathematics, physics, and engineering, and could lead to breakthroughs in areas such as quantum computing, materials science, and robotics.

By using "Hyper-Oculus" to build this four-dimensional meta world, we hope to create a community of users who are passionate about exploring the fourth dimension and pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the universe.

And then I thought, perhaps we were 2D beings in the past, and our ancestors created a 3D meta world by utilizing their knowledge of mathematics in 2D, and then migrated to the 3D meta world they created, allowing them to live a 3D life from birth to death.

## Roadmap
The development of Hyper-Oculus is at an early stage (Phase 1, currently), with much work needed in the fields of software engineering, programming languages, computer graphics, math, and graphics API like Vulkan. The following is a roadmap of the project:

 - Phase 1: Implement basic features of the Hyper-Oculus project, including the rendering of a four-dimensional hypercube and camera movement in the 4D space.
 - Phase 2: Add support for user-defined objects and transformations in 4D.
 - Phase 3: Create a user interface for the project, allowing users to easily explore and manipulate objects in the 4D space.
 - Phase 4: Implement a simple physics engine to simulate interactions between objects.
 - Phase 5: Introduce advanced scripting and AI for complex behavior of 4D objects.
 - Phase 6: Support for multiplayer interactions in 4D space.
 - Phase 7: Ray tracing in 4D (Not Urgent).
 - Phase 8: Integrate the project with VR/AR technologies, allowing for a more immersive and interactive experience.
